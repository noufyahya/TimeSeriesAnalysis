### Decompsing the data 
The reason we decompose the data is to understand the underlying patterns of the data. Decomposing the original data into its components might explain why the data is like this. Is there anything that you need to understand about it? The data will help you answer business questions, such as when sales are at their highest and why. It will also show you the trend it's following—whether upward or downward—in case it wasn’t clear.
